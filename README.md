# Simple Bar Chart 

this will display simple bar chart of student academic record.the script purely writeen only in vanilla javascript,HTML and CSS. today we have many options for displaying the bar chart and that is easy to use and user-frinedly but making from scatch has been diffrant experince for me. i didnt use any frameworks because i want to highlight the work that had been done in the script should be javascript.i have used json data set for display the data.Also i have attached the screenshot of the chart from my local machine.we can add more data, as of now i have make it simple. index.js file have all comments for the logical flow of how the code go from one way to other way.if you have any question feel free to ask. it is compatible with most of all the modern browser.
